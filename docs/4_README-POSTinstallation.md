> ## Post Installtion:

1. Install OpenCore on the main boot EFI partition to enable boot without the installation media. A good utility to mount your EFI folder is [corpnewt/MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI).
2. Please reference my uploaded EFI folder to determine my current bootloader configurations as well as which kexts I am currently using. Note that for CPUFriend, please generate your own DataProvider kexts per different machine specifications and desired configurations. Use [one-key-cpufriend](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend).
3. Copy the kexts you will be using to their respective directories, per bootloaders:

- OpenCore: `EFI/OC/Kexts/`

For the kexts you will be using, make sure to create matching entries within `OpenCore.plist`'s `Kernel/Add/` section.

\*Refer to my uploaded EFI folder for my current kext list.

5. Refer to the table below for the other post installtion configurations for each particular issue. Some issues are easy to fix, simply requiring a kext installtion or running a script, while others are my involved and require SSDT patching.
6. For those other, more complicated issues, proceed to `4_README-ACPIpatching.md`
