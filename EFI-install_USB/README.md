# OpenCore Configuration for the Install Drive

## This OpenCore configuration is purposely kept bareboned. Its sole purpose is for installing and booting macOS first time. Please refer to my `EFI-Opencore` folder the OpenCore configuration intended for daily use.

### It is generally a good idea to keep the install drive with OpenCore around. As you tweak your own `opencore.plist`, things may break and you will not be able to get back into macOS using the system's OpenCore. In those times, you can use the install drive to boot into macOS.
